# CalcMenuBar

A menubar calculator available even when other apps are in full-size view. CalcMenuBar is an emulation of the Apple Basic Calculator with Memory Funcitions.

Right-clicking on the Results window pops up a contextual menu to set the app to launch at startup.

Copy/Paste moves the Results view to/from the clipboard. The app also remembers its state in its Standard Defaults.
